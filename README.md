Changes I made

1. Modified the dockerfile for localsetup
2. Revised the frontend folder structure and replaced hardcoded values with backend api values and made some ui changes.
3. Modified the backend folder structure and completed the POST and GET methods 
4. Made the necessary changes to make the code production ready - added error handling in api, modularized the code, etc.

I have tested the setup on my local and all the three services are running fine and smoothly.
